# AutoDecideMath

AutoDecideMath is a simple Python script that helps you automatically choose the correct mathematical operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`) to complete a given expression and match the desired result.

## 🔍 What It Does

Given an input like:
```
10 ? 2 = 20
```
The script will determine which operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) should replace the `?` to make the equation valid.

In this case, it will output:
```
10 * 2 = 20
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/InvarGervi123/autodecidemath.git
cd autodecidemath
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

3. Enter the expression in this format:
```
number1 ? number2 = result
```

> Example input:
```
5 ? 4 = 9
```

> Example output:
```
5 + 4 = 9
```
